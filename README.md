In Math 215 (Differential Equations), what I find most interesting about the class is that it can be used for modeling. Of course, practically speaking, data (life) does not follow a perfect constant because if it did, the concept of regression equations would become less impactful.
By introducing the modeling of battery charging for my Tesla Model Y (I will change the topic from semester to semester), I aim to motivate the importance of differential equations and regression equations. The modeling questions will always appear as the last question on each take-home assignments.
In take-home 1, the modeling process begins with basic algebra. From there, we extend the concept to more complex structures, such as regression lines and exponential regression lines. By take-home 5, we end with the logistic equation.
Hopefully, by leading the students through these takehomes they see a small sampling of how models can be created.
Hopefully, by leading the students through these take-homes, they will see a small sampling of how models can be created. The solutions for the take-homes (the last question) were created in Jupyter using Python.
For the upcoming semester, I will try to construct the PageRank algorithm through small structures, as seen in these take-homes.
